# boilergen :fire:

### Generator based on create-react-app for some small apps

Includes SASS, material ui, react-animated-css and a base folder so you can match your project structure.

You can run this script at your projects folder with 

`sudo node boilergen.js`

The boileger_model folder must be at the same level folder of the script.
